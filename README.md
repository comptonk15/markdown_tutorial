# markdown_tutorial
This is a tutorial on how to use markdown. Markdown is a plaintext language, meaning it uses symbols and letters rather than syntax. It has the ability to control the layout of text and files. In this tutorial we will walk through the basics of using markdown. You will first need to start by opening your preferred editor and creating a file with an .md (markdown) extension. From there you can start typing your plain text that you will later learn to format using markdown's language.
