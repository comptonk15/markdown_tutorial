# markdown_tutorial
This is a tutorial on how to use markdown. Markdown is a plaintext language, meaning it uses symbols and letters rather than syntax. It has the ability to control the layout of text and files. In this tutorial we will walk through the basics of using markdown. You will first need to start by opening your preferred editor and creating a file with an .md (markdown) extension. From there you can start typing your plain text that you will later learn to format using markdown's language.

# Headers
You can indicate a Header by using one or multiple \# before your text you want to format as a header

# _Italic Letters_
You can represent _italic_ letters by placing either an \*astrisk\* or an \_underscore\_ around the text you would like to add emphasis to.
***

# __Bold Letters__
You can represent __bold__ letters by placing two \*\*astrisks\*\* or two \_\_underscores\_\_ surrounding the text you would like to make bold.
***

# ~~Strike Through~~
You can strike through a text by placing two \~\~squiqles\~\~ before and after the text you want to strike through
***

# Lists
Lists are very simple to use in MarkDown. To indicate the use of a list all you need to do is place a number before the list item. For example
\1. First ordered list item
\2. Another item
\⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list.
\1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
\⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
\4. And another item.

As you can see, it does not matter which number is used. MarkDown knows to interpret numbers as lists.

# Links
There are multiple options to implementing links using MarkDown. The first option is an inline style link:

\[inline-style link\]\(https://www.google.com\)

This will create a text that reads [I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com) and when clicked will link to the google url.
